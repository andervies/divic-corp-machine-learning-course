# divic-corp-machine-learning-course
This repository contains the assignments and projects completed during my participation in the machine learning course sponsored by AOTS  and facilitated by DIVIC Corp. Each project showcases my understanding and practical application of various machine learning algorithms and techniques. 

Through this repository, I aim to demonstrate my growing proficiency in machine learning and my ability to apply theoretical concepts to real-world datasets and problems.
